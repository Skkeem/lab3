How do Whisker switches work?

Main idea:
	active-low output <fig>

	Whisker

Where are IR Sensors applicable? Give an example and explain.
	help drivers, autonomous vehicles, security(detect whether the door is open, detect whether something intruded), measurement, etc. smoke detection/ 물성


If your robot (having only one IR sensor) is approaching the corner, how would you
program to avoid it? Explain your algorithm.
